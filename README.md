## About Test

Steps
1 - git clone https://github.com/GilmarBrito/kcsit.git
2 - Open bash project directory and type: docker-compose up
3 - Open browser: http://localhost/

I had some issues with my docker installation, so I lost one entire day.
So, I write below some points.
Improvement points:
1 - I didn't make tests, because I didn't with Laravel 7 ever.
2 - I did as Laravel way of life, but I don't like with some validations and other model things inner a Controller, because controllers should be work just to requests. To solve this issue, I'll implement Repository/Services pattern.

My best regards!
